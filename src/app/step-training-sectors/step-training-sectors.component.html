                        largely self-reliant in agriculture. Accordingly, the

                        to generating higher and stable income for the farming

                        create alternate employment opportunities, improve
                        exports and strengthen the domestic supply chain.

                        the world, is ranked first in the production of milk,

                         One such mesmerizing art form is Indian embroidery, which has not just survived the tolls of time and innumerable invasions, in fact more than this.
                          As a result, Indian embroidery has been influenced by various rich cultures and every Indian region has a different flavor of its own.
                          Our NGOs works with thousands of women embroidery artisans in different regions of India, 
                          and each one is a member of an embroidery collective or non-profit organization. 
                          The women do the embroidery work in their homes, and this gives them the freedom to earn a sustainable livelihood through 
                          their craft whenever they have free time throughout the day.  </p>

                    <p>Women and girls are trapped in a cycle of poverty by a lack of diverse and market responsive education
                         and skill building opportunities. Many girls are pulled out of school to take over household responsibilities 
                         and never develop the skills to enter the job market.In soft skill sessions, our NGOs has been practising the best and organised sessions on etiquettes,
                         on how to talk, carrying a pleasing personality, sitting and walking with a proper posture. 
                         Personal counselling, goal setting are the other themes that are worked upon. Beneficiaries are trained 
                         to face the job market as well the competitive world outside. All the courses offered by our NGOs develop soft skills and provide
                          personality development, leadership building, spoken English and team-work experience.</p>
